FAIRyTale 
Give your data a happily-ever-after

Description: 
This project provides a program to automatically create a local repository structured according to **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and **Open Science** principles. It is designed to help researchers organize and prepare their materials for publication in open repositories like OSF, Zenodo, or GitHub.

Creators:
Florencia Altschuler, Annika Andersson, Jaime Rios, Iliana Sandoval

Features:
- Creates a local repository
- Automated creation of FAIR-aligned folder structured and organized
- Templates for metadata and README files
- Promotes reproducibility and transparency
- Compatible with OSF, Zenodo, GitHub

License:

Project Structure:

The repository will include the following folders:

Software needed to read the data files.
- Python 3.7+ 

Installation:

Step-by-step instructions on how to install or set up the project locally.


Clone the repository:


```
git clone https://github.com/NeuroHackademy2025/open-science-pipeline.git
```


Navigate to the project directory

```
cd your-repository
```

Create and activate a virtual environment

```
conda create -n FAIRyTale python=3.12
```
```
conda activate FAIRyTale
```

Install the required dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application
After the dependencies are installed, you can run the Streamlit app. Use the following command to start the app:
```
streamlit run run_FAIRyTale_pipeline.py
```

This should launch the Streamlit application in your web browser.
